# A ProseMirror example

The official [ProseMirror menu example](http://prosemirror.net/examples/menu/) says

> If you already have some kind of dataflow abstraction that you're routing ProseMirror updates though, **writing the menu as a separate component** and connecting it to the editor state should work well.

In this example, the menu is written in [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp), and then binded to ProseMirror.
